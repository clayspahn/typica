    <h1>Typica Type</h1>
    <h2>American Type Foundry</h2>

    <p>We create typefaces and custom lettering with the intent to sell to students, individuals, companies, and organizations. Our typefaces are designed with Glyphs 3.</p>

    <p>Typica exists because of our love of typography that grew through our time living in Rome.</p>

    <p>We are open to established or hopeful type designers to reach out to us with their work and ideas. We would love to talk to you about our plan to showcase incredible 21st century American typography design.</p>
